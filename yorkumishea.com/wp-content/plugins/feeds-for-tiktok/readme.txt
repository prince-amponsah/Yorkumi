Yes, though this is a feature of our paid [pro version](https://smashballoon.com/tiktok-feeds/?utm_campaign=tiktok-free-readme&utm_source=mp4player&utm_medium=proversion "TikTok Feed Pro") only at this time.

= Can I play videos from a TikTok account I don't own? =

There may be a JavaScript error on the page preventing the code that creates the feed from loading. Check the browser console for errors. You could also disable other plugins and switch themes to see what might be causing the problem.

Use the support forum and one of our representatives will help you get going with your TikTok Feed as quickly as possible.
